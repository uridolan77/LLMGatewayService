# Enhanced Provider Architecture

## Overview

The LLM Gateway provider architecture has been enhanced with integrated Phase 1 and Phase 2 capabilities, providing comprehensive error handling, monitoring, caching, content filtering, and advanced features.

## Enhanced Base Provider

### Key Features

1. **Integrated Services**
   - Circuit breaker for resilience
   - Token counting with model-specific tokenizers
   - Enhanced caching with provider-aware keys
   - Content filtering for prompts and completions
   - Comprehensive metrics collection

2. **Enhanced Completion Flow**
   ```
   Request → Content Filter → Cache Check → Token Estimation → 
   Circuit Breaker → Provider API → Content Filter → Cache Store → 
   Metrics Recording → Response
   ```

3. **Streaming Support**
   - Enhanced streaming with per-chunk filtering
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Metrics tracking for streaming operations

### Abstract Methods

Providers must implement:
- `CreateCompletionInternalAsync()` - Core completion logic
- `CreateCompletionStreamInternalAsync()` - Core streaming logic

### Helper Methods

The base provider provides:
- Content filtering for prompts and completions
- Cache key generation with request fingerprinting
- Intelligent cache duration based on temperature
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Provider Implementations

### OpenAI Provider

Enhanced with:
- Detailed activity tracing
- Health monitoring with metrics
- Enhanced error handling
- Streaming optimization

### Anthropic Provider

Enhanced with:
- Claude-specific optimizations
- Multi-modal support preparation
- Enhanced streaming handling
- Health monitoring

### Cohere Provider

Enhanced with:
- Command model optimizations
- Embedding support
- Enhanced chat history handling
- Health monitoring

## Dependency Injection

### Service Registration

```csharp
// Enhanced services are automatically injected
services.AddScoped<OpenAIProvider>();
services.AddScoped<AnthropicProvider>();
services.AddScoped<CohereProvider>();
```

### Required Services

Each provider receives:
- `ICircuitBreakerService` - For resilience
- `ITokenCountingService` - For token estimation
- `IEnhancedCacheService` - For intelligent caching
- `IContentFilteringService` - For safety
- `IMetricsService` - For observability

## Benefits

1. **Error Handling**
   - Circuit breaker pattern
   - Comprehensive exception handling
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Monitoring**
   - Detailed metrics collection
   - Health check integration
   - Activity tracing

3. **Token Counting**
   - Pre-request estimation
   - Model-specific tokenizers
   - Cost optimization

4. **Caching**
   - Intelligent cache keys
   - Temperature-based duration
   - Provider-aware caching

5. **Security**
   - Content filtering
   - Prompt safety checks
   - Response sanitization

### Phase 2 Enhancements

1. **Advanced Caching**
   - Sliding expiration
   - Cache hit/miss metrics
   - Provider-specific strategies

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Per-provider health checks
   - Detailed performance metrics
   - Streaming operation tracking

3. **Content Safety**
   - Real-time filtering
   - Configurable policies
   - Audit logging

## Usage Examples

### Basic Completion

```csharp
var provider = serviceProvider.GetService<OpenAIProvider>();
var response = await provider.CreateCompletionAsync(request);
// Automatically includes: filtering, caching, monitoring, error handling
```

### Streaming Completion

```csharp
await foreach (var chunk in provider.CreateCompletionStreamAsync(request))
{
    // Each chunk is filtered and monitored
    Console.Write(chunk.Choices[0].Delta?.Content);
}
```

## Configuration

### Provider Options

Each provider supports enhanced configuration:
- Circuit breaker settings
- Cache duration policies
- Content filtering rules
- Health check intervals

### Metrics Configuration

Comprehensive metrics are collected:
- Request/response times
- Token usage
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates
- Provider health status

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 Preparation

The architecture is designed to support:
- Fine-tuning management
- Advanced cost tracking
- Multi-modal processing
- A/B testing capabilities
- Advanced routing strategies

### Extensibility

New providers can easily inherit the enhanced capabilities by:
1. Extending `BaseLLMProvider`
2. Implementing the required abstract methods
3. Registering with dependency injection
4. Configuring provider-specific options

## Migration Guide

### Existing Providers

To migrate existing providers:
1. Update constructor to accept enhanced services
2. Replace direct API calls with `CreateCompletionInternalAsync`
3. Update streaming methods to use `CreateCompletionStreamInternalAsync`
4. Remove manual error handling (now handled by base class)
5. Remove manual caching logic (now handled by base class)

### Benefits of Migration

- Reduced code duplication
- Consistent error handling
- Automatic monitoring
- Built-in caching
- Enhanced security
- Better observability
